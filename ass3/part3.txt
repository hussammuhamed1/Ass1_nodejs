1:
    The Node.js Event Loop is the mechanism that allows Node.js to handle multiple operations asynchronously using a single thread.
2:
    Libuv is a cross-platform C library that provides Node.js with asynchronous
    It implements the Event Loop used by Node.js.
    Handles non-blocking operations    
3:
    JavaScript runs on a single thread
    The main thread executes synchronous code only.
    Libuv handles the work
    Uses the OS kernel for non-blocking
    Uses a thread pool for blocking tasks    
4:
    Call Stack
    A data structure that keeps track of function calls.
    Event Queue 
    A queue that stores callbacks of completed asynchronous operations.
    Event Loop
    A controller mechanism
5:
    The Node.js Thread Pool is a set of background worker threads provided by Libuv to handle blocking or CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main event loop.
    set with : UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node app.js
6:
    Blocking Code
    Blocking code runs synchronously on the Call Stack.
    It stops the Event Loop until it finishes.
    Non-Blocking Code
    Non-blocking code is handled asynchronously.
    The task is delegated to Libuv or the OS kernel.
